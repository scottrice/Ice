DownloadedEmulator represents an emulator which I download from a specific 
location. This location should be defined in the emulator subclass as opposed
to as a parameter, as I dont think it would be possible to create a class
suitable for all cases if it was a parameter

Functionality should be added here if it involves the downloading of emulators,
or if it involves managing the downloaded emulators
