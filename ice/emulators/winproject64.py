        The command string format for Project 64 is just...
        \"C:\Path\To\Project64\" C:\Path\To\ROM
        
        Notice the quotes around the path to Project 64, but the lack of quotes
        around the path to the ROM. This is intended in PJ64 1.6.
        
        Since we need to get the keybindings correct, Project64 needs a 
        launcher. The launcher has no such qualms about quotes, and so the
        standard
        \"C:\Path\To\Project64\" \"C:\Path\To\ROM\"
