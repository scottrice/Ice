# The path to place your ROMs Directory. This can be in any drive or anywhere,
# as long as the full path is specified. Use ~ to represent your home folder
# (for example, C:\Users\Scott\)
#
# Ice will place a folder called ROMs at the specified location. 
# 
# Example:
# ~                     => C:\Users\<YOUR USERNAME>\ROMs
# C:\                   => C:\ROMs
# C:\Program Files      => C:\Program Files\ROMs
# D:\Steam              => D:\Steam\ROMs
# D:\ROMs               => D:\ROMs\ROMs <-- It will work, but looks awful
ROMs Directory=~
