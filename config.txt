[Grid Images]
# The website listed should provide the grid images used by Ice. This URL will
# most likely need to be provided by the website itself, as it is fairly specific.
#
# The default is ConsoleGrid (consolegrid.com/api/top_picture)
#
# If this field is left blank, Ice will not attempt to download images
