![Example of Ice using thegamesdb.net boxart images](ice-example-new.png "Example")

##Ice (TheGamesDB.net Addon)

###Description

This fork adds a new provider to download images from thegamesdb.net
It also generates nicer coverimages if the coverimage doesnt fit steam banner size.

Have fun with it.

###License

All of my code is licensed under MIT.

###Getting Started

Ice's official documentation is available at [Getting Started.](http://scottrice.github.io/Ice/getting-started/) 

###Running the Source

You will need Python 2.7 to run Ice. Python 3.0 and up will not work.

You will also need pip installed. The easiest way to get that is to run `easy_install pip`.

Next, you will need to download all of Ice's dependencies. To do so, run `python setup.py install`

Once all of that is finished, simply run `python -m ice` from the repository's root directory.
