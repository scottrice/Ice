Copyright (c) 2012 Scott Rice. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this class is to handle the interaction (or some would say 
conversion) between ROMs and Steam Shortcuts. This class also handles checking
to make sure I don't add duplicates of any ROMs to Steam.

Functionality should be added to this class if it involves the interaction
between ROMs and Steam Shortcuts.
