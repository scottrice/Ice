todo:

config files either gone and all hardcoded or move config files
launch script
do things in home directories! Like creating roms directories and searching for roms
init script to update, but only if changes have been made
emulators as dependencies for package and fully configured for launch

actual requirements:

from debian: zsnes mupen64plus python-pip(if used for installing) python-psutil(also available with pip)
python: pysteam appdirs
dunno if needed: libxrandr2:i386(was in old setup script)
