todo:

no more config files, only ice
launch script
do things in home directories!
init script to update, but only if changes have been made
emulators as dependencies for package and fully configured for launch

actual requirements:

from debian: zsnes mupen64plus python-pip(if used for installing) python-psutil(also available with pip)
python: pysteam appdirs
dunno if needed: libxrandr2:i386(was in old setup script)
