Description: ICE is a program / utility to bring emulation to Steam Big Picture Mode.
 The purpose of this project is to leverage Steam's Big Picture mode to turn it into
 an emulator frontend (similar to Hyperspin). It accomplishes this by creating folders
 in specified locations on the user's hard drive, then adding any ROMs that are placed
 in these folders to Steam as non-Steam games. Emulators are installed and configured
 by the user before Ice is run.
 .
 This package is targeted at SteamOS.
